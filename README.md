# Personal Python Standards + Project Template

### Project Template - Pygame

**main.py** - contains generic "Game" class and the event, draw and update loops

**lib.py** - still need a better name for this file. Global reference file, useful for bypassing circular import issues

**debug.py** - basic mouse position and framerate information, accessible by pressing [TAB]

### Personal Standards

Personal standards influenced by a handful of Python PEPs, most notably:
 - PEP 8
 - PEP 257
